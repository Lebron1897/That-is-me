# That is me

I´m an active person who can´t stand without anything to do, I have the need to strive my best effort in everything that I do whatsoever in or out of work. Willing to gather as much understanding as I can.
Arduous with myself and the job, always trying to reach the highest degree I can, with my own ambition, obsessed with perfection and order.

I thrive in high-pressure and fast-paced environments striving for positive results by applying my knowledge and teamwork abilities furthermore, I possess expertise in developing system functionality and acumen for maximising performance. I am able to visualise success and identify unconventional, yet highly effective strategies for achieving it.

I have skilfully balanced organisational objectives and productive relationships, as demonstrated in my leadership and motivation talents have supported my professional growth. I thrive in environments where I can strategize and recommend ways in which to achieve and maintain a competitive business edge.

I am a person who loves to carry out some personal projects with which people have the possibility to interact and enjoy them. Every project I do, as a hobby or for an institution, is focused on comfortable use for people and that at few times can make their lives easier.
